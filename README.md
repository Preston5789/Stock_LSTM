# Stock Predictor RNN
In this project I build an RNN (recurrent-neural-network) in Keras used for predicting stock prices.

For this example, I will predict Apple's stock price 7 days in advance. The particular network architecture I will employ for my RNN is a  [Long Term Short Memory (LTSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory), which helps significantly avoid technical problems with optimization of RNNs.
